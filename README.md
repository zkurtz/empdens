# pydens, density estimation in python

COMING SOON - A scalable and modular implementation of 
[classifier-adjusted density estimation](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e4e6/033069a8569ba16f64da3061538bcb90bec6.pdf)
with a unified interface to other density estimation packages.

Applications of density estimation include

- feature engineering - the density of at a point can be a useful feature in supervized learning
- anomaly detection: points of low density can be interpreted as anomalies.
